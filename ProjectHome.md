Live Robot Programming (LRP) is a live programming language designed for the creation of the behavior layer of robots. As such, it is a nested state machine language whose interpreter was built with robotics applications in mind.

LRP is not bound to a specific robot infrastructure, bridges to a given infrastructure are add-ons to the language. The language can therefore also be used 'simply' as a nested state machine live programming language. Currently LRP provides a bridge to [ROS](http://www.ros.org) and to the Lego Mindstorms EV3 via [JetStorm](http://www.phratch.com/jetstorm).
For more information on LRP we refer to the home page: http://pleiad.cl/lrp

The Google code website (this thing right here!) is currently only used for the bugtracker. More stuff here is to follow, when our resources permit it.
